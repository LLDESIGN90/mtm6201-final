## Process

### Development Approach
The development of this portfolio was structured and methodical. I started by planning the overall structure and design of the site, referencing the high-fidelity designs created during my User Experience Design course. The main goal was to create a responsive and accessible website using the Bootstrap framework to ensure consistency and ease of development.

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Responsive Design**: One of the key challenges was ensuring that the website was fully responsive across different devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Using Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities, I was able to create a layout that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

2. **Accessibility**: Making the site accessible to all users was a priority. This involved adding ARIA roles and attributes, ensuring proper HTML semantics, and including skip links for better navigation. Learning about and implementing accessibility features was a significant learning curve but ultimately rewarding.

3. **Image Optimization**: Optimizing images for different screen sizes was another challenge. I used the `<picture>` element with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to provide multiple versions of images, ensuring fast load times and good performance on all devices.

### Learnings
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Through this project, I deepened my understanding of the Bootstrap framework, learning how to effectively use its grid system, components, and utilities to build a responsive and consistent layout.
- **Accessibility**: Implementing accessibility features taught me the importance of inclusive design. I learned how to use ARIA roles, landmarks, and attributes to make the site more navigable for users with disabilities.
- **Image Handling**: I gained valuable experience in image optimization techniques, which is crucial for improving site performance and user experience.
